                    <h3>Basketball</h3>
                    <P>It's that captures the imagination and forces you to be relentless, ambitious, and optimistic. It forces you to cry, feel shitty, and then work through it all. It makes you accept the good, and the bad. It makes you love work, and it finally pays off you’ll love it even more. It’s an outlet, and a distraction but above all it’s life.</P>

                    <h3>Coding</h3>
                    <P>It teaches you to take logical steps in developing solutions to complex problems. A child learns how to: break down complicated problems into simple steps. solve problems one step at a time rather than everything at once (which is how most real-word problems are solved</P>

                    <P>The real-life applications of Mathematics are endless. We are surrounded by numbers, equations and algorithms – especially in this age of data science, with huge data sets that can only be understood through statistical models and analysis. Maths gives us the ability to view the world in a way nothing else can!</P>
